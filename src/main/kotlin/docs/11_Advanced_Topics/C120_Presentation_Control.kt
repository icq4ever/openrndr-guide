    # Presentation Control

    OPENRNDR programs can use any of the two presentation modes.

    The default mode is automatic presentation, the `draw` method is called as often as possible. The other mode is manual presentation, in which
    it is the developer's responsibility to request `draw` to be called.

    ##### Setting the presentation mode

    The presentation mode can be set and changed at run-time.

        program {
            window.presentationMode = PresentationMode.AUTOMATIC
        }
    }


    @Text
    """
    ##### Using the manual presentation mode

    The presentation mode is set to manual, a request to draw can be made using `window.requestDraw`.

    In the following example `draw()` is only called after a mouse click.

    Note that in manual presentation mode `draw()` is still called when the window is resized.
