    Quaternions represent rotation through an extension of complex numbers. A full explanation of quaternions and their intrinsics is out of this document's scope, in this section however enough information is provided to use quaternion's effectively as a tool.
    
    In practice quaternions are rarely constructed directly as it is fairly difficult to get an intuition for its argument values.
