    ## The `ScreenRecorder` extension

    A much simpler way of writing your program's output to video is
    offered by the `ScreenRecorder` extension. The extension creates video 
    files named after your Program class name plus the date. 
    For example: `MyProgram-2018-04-11-11.31.03.mp4`. The video files 
    are located in the `video/` directory in your project.

    To setup the screen recorder do the following:
    """

    @Code
    application {
        program {
            extend(ScreenRecorder())
            extend {

            }
        }
    }

    @Text
    """
    ### Toggle the `ScreenRecorder` on and off
    
    By default the screen recorder extension adds video frames as long as the
    program runs. If you keep running the program again and again you will end
    up with a folder full of video files.
    
    We can make it more flexible by letting the user start and pause the
    recorder, for instance by pressing the `v` key on the keyboard.
